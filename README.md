# How to run
Run `make` in the root directory of th  git repository. `tc1.elf`, the compiled executable, will be created in that directory and can be moved to a location where RedBoot can access it and then loaded. Once the `go` command has been given in RedBoot, the train control user interface will appear and the user can begin train control. 
A pre-existing compiled `tc1.elf` file can be found in `/u/cs452/tftp/ARM/lmcvitti/` on the student linux servers.
