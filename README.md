# How to run
Run `make` in the root directory of the git repository. `k3.elf`, the compiled executable, will be created in that directory and can be moved to a location where RedBoot can access it and then loaded. Once the `go` command has been given in RedBoot, there is no further input needed from the user; the tasks will start and execute immediately and the program will terminate after they are completed.  
A pre-existing compiled `k3.elf` file can be found in `/u/cs452/tftp/ARM/y247pan/` on the student linux servers.
